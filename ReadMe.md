## Project Title

**GardenPlot** - Tokenized Community Garden Plots

## Project Description

The **GardenPlot** contract enables the tokenization of community garden plots using non-fungible tokens (NFTs) on the Ethereum blockchain. Garden plots are represented as NFTs, where each token corresponds to a specific plot in a garden. The contract allows for the creation, rental, and management of garden plots, and users can participate in community activities linked to these plots. 

This system enables:
- Plot owners to rent out their plots for a fixed price (in Wei).
- Participants to rent plots for specific durations.
- Garden activities to be organized, where participants can join with their owned plots.
- The ability to transfer plot ownership in a decentralized manner using NFTs.

## Project Vision

The vision of **GardenPlot** is to create a decentralized platform that brings community garden plots to the blockchain, making it easier to rent, transfer, and manage garden spaces. By tokenizing plots as NFTs, we enable a fair, transparent, and secure way to manage these plots. This project aims to promote sustainable living and increase community engagement by providing a digital marketplace for renting and participating in garden-based activities.

## Future Scope

- **Global Garden Network**: Expand the platform to support multiple gardens globally, each with its own set of unique plots.
- **Automated Plot Pricing**: Implement a dynamic pricing model based on demand, location, and size of the plot.
- **NFT Integration for Community Activities**: Implement NFT tickets for specific activities within the garden, allowing users to collect and trade them.
- **Multi-owner Support**: Allow multiple individuals or entities to own and manage a single plot, enhancing collaborative gardening.
- **Advanced Rental Options**: Introduce features like recurring rentals, discounts for long-term rentals, or token-based loyalty programs.
- **Sustainability Tracking**: Implement features to track and reward sustainable gardening practices, such as organic gardening or eco-friendly initiatives.

## Key Features

- **Create and Mint Plots as NFTs**: Owners can create new plots with a specified price, size, and location, minting each plot as a unique NFT.
- **Rent Garden Plots**: Users can rent a plot for a specific duration (measured in days), and the ownership of the NFT is temporarily transferred to the renter.
- **Plot Rental Management**: The owner or renter can end the rental, with the plot becoming available for others to rent.
- **Organize Community Activities**: Garden activities can be organized, and plot owners can join activities, encouraging engagement within the community.
- **Track Participants**: The contract can track the participants of each activity and show the relationship between garden plots and their owners.
- **Withdraw Funds**: The owner of the contract (garden owner) can withdraw collected funds (rent) from the contract.
- **Transparent and Decentralized**: All the processes are handled by smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain, ensuring transparency and fairness.
